# Starting The Game

The **Quantum Simple FPS** game can be started either through the startup scene with menu (`Scenes/Startup`) where players can navigate to various options including starting a new deathmatch game, or directly by launching the gameplay scene (`Scenes/Deathmatch`) to jump right into the action.

## Controls

- Use `W`, `S`, `A`, `D` for movement, `SPACE` for jumping, and `Left Mouse Button` to fire.
- Switch between collected weapons using `1`, `2`, `3`, and reload a weapon with `R`.
- Press `F` to spray images onto nearby surfaces, adding an extra element of fun.
- Lock or release your cursor inside the Unity Editor using the `ENTER` key.

## Startup Scene

The **Quantum Simple FPS** incorporates the standard Photon Menu, allowing players to quickly connect and start a match.
