The **Platform Shooter 2D** sample is provided with full source code and demonstrates how Quantum 3 can be used to create a fast and action-packed online 2D platform shooter. The sample has been around since Quantum 1 and was originally called _Blueless_ and developed by BitCake Studio for Photon Engine. In the recent iteration the sample has been transformed to Quantum 3 and received an new kinematic character controller implementation.

Technical highlights and features are:

- A new 2D kinematic character controller
- Raycast projectiles based on delta-movement
- Usage of the Quantum 3 [entity view component framework](/quantum/current/manual/entity-view-component)
- [Data-driven polymorphism](/quantum/current/manual/assets/assets-simulation#data_driven_polymorphism) for Quantum assets
- Respawn points with [entity prototypes](/quantum/current/manual/entity-prototypes)
- Players entering the character selection while the simulation is already running
