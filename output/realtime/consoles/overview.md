# Overview

We are making sure that Photon is available on all of the major gaming platforms, including gaming consoles.

However, our downloads and documentation for these platforms are only available to certified developers.

## Credentials Verification

As a first step, we need to verify your credentials per console.

For the **PlayStation** consoles (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5) and **Nintendo Switch**, you can find Photon on the respective middleware section in their developer pages.

For the **Xbox** consoles (Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S), you currently have to ask your point of contact at Microsoft to email us a verification on your behalf.

Make sure [\[emailÂ protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) is in CC for this.

## Documentation and Downloads

Once your credentials are verified, we will "tag" your Photon developer account(s).

With that done, you can access the documentation and downloads for the console(s).
