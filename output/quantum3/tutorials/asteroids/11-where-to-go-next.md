# 11 - Where to go next

## Overview

This tutorial established a foundation for creating a game in Quantum. However, there is much more to learn about it. This section recommends the next steps to follow in your journey.

### Asteroids Sample

Quantum comes with a more complete asteroids sample project. This sample is included in the Quantum SDK download. To explore it, create a new Unity project, import the Quantum SDK and then import the `Quantum-Asteroids` package in `Assets/Photon/QuantumAsteroids`.

The sample comes with many additional features that are not present in the tutorial such as:

- Custom view scripts.
- Scoring system including UI.
- Particle systems controlled by thrusters.
- Full game loop including respawning and selecting a winner.
- Ammo system including UI ammo bar.
- Player names.

### Other Quantum Samples

The samples showcase many ways of using Quantum to build various styles of gameplay. From fast-paced platformer and racing games to Chess, the API is explored and exemplified and can be used as a starting point. Every sample has a Level tag at the top of it's page which informs how advanced the sample is. Starting with Beginner level samples is the best next step from this point.

### Quantum Manual

The first pages you should read in the manual are the ones covering the Quantum [DSL](/quantum/current/manual/quantum-ecs/dsl) (Domain Specific Language) and the [Entity Prototypes](/quantum/current/manual/entity-prototypes). These are at the core of programming the simulation and designing the view, respectively.

### Video Tutorial

For a video tutorial you can check out the [Complete Course to Quantum 3](/quantum/current/tutorials/video-tutorial) stream.

### Game Samples

Alternatively there are many [Game Samples](/quantum/current/game-samples/platform-shooter-2d/overview) to download.
