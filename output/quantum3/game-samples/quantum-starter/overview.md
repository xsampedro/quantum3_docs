**Quantum Starter** is an entry-level game sample designed for testing and learning about Quantum, and enjoying multiplayer gameplay with friends and colleagues.

![Platformer Screenshot](/docs/img/quantum/v3/game-samples/starter/Platformer.jpg)

The project consists of a series of small, independent examples. Each example has its own folder and namespace. Currently, there are three examples available:

- [Third Person Character](/quantum/current/game-samples/quantum-starter/project-architecture#third-person-character)
- [Platformer](/quantum/current/game-samples/quantum-starter/project-architecture#platformer)
- [Shooter](/quantum/current/game-samples/quantum-starter/project-architecture#shooter)

Quantum Starter is designed with a simple approach and understandable code in mind. All scripts are thoroughly commented to aid understanding. It is therefore accessible for beginners while still respecting Quantum best practices. Test how everything stays butter-smooth even under poor networking conditions.
