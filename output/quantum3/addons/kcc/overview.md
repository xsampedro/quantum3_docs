## Overview

The **KCC** is a 3D kinematic character controller addon with strong focus on player movement and interactions with the game world. It utilizes state-of-the-art techniques to ensure exceptional, butter-smooth gaming experience to your players.

It also provides some level of customization, allowing you to create the perfect character control system tailored to your game's needs, with great performance and efficiency without compromising on quality.

丘멆잺 It is recommended to start by exploring [Sample Project](/quantum/current/addons/kcc/sample-project) which implements basic player logic, input processing and includes several gameplay oriented examples.

![KCC](/docs/img/quantum/v3/addons/kcc/overview.jpg)## Features

Following list contains features implemented in KCC.

- 游릭 Control over position and look rotation (pitch + yaw). Works correctly with Transform3D.
- 游릭 Capsule based physics query and depenetration.
- 游릭 Support for Gravity.
- 游릭 Support for Jump.
- 游릭 Ground detection.
- 游릭 Continuous collision detection (CCD) out of the box.
- 游릭 Support for ignoring child colliders.
- 游릭 Step detection and ground snapping.
- 游릭 Platform independent, mobile friendly.
- 游릭 Performance optimized.
- 游릭 Dynamic (physics-like) and kinematic (unconstrained) velocity based movement.
- 游릭 Support for external forces (from other gameplay objects).
- 游릭 Pipeline driven by Processors for movement logic modularization.
- 游릭 Support for interactions - manually registered Modifier and Collision based.
- 游릭 Advanced collision and interaction filtering - callbacks, collider ignore list.
- 游릭 Collision enter/exit callbacks.
- 游릭 Base environment implementation with acceleration and friction models for movement.
- 游릭 Commented sample and testing playground.
