## Introduction

**Bots for Single player, Local & Online Multiplayer**

Bots can be tremendously important for the success of a multiplayer game. Two of the main advantages of having Bots are:

1. **Bots can fill up rooms when there are not enough players connected**. This can greatly improve the experience players in early stages of the a game release as they can play with bots and not depend entirely on the game already having enough players for quickly filling up rooms;
2. **Bots can also be used to replace players who got disconnected**, and players can get back the control of their entities again if they reconnect to the game.

Bot SDK can be a huge time saver, especially when used on early stages of a game's development as it is built with a custom editor in Unity which allows for fast prototyping which also gives game/level designers a lot of power when tweaking gameplay directly within the editor.

The **Quantum Bot SDK Development** version of the addon is currently only available to users with an active **[Photon Gaming Circle](https://www.photonengine.com/Gaming)** or **[Photon Industries Circle](https://www.photonengine.com/Industries)** subscription.

Your **Gaming Circle** membership provides all samples, SDKs and support needed to create and launch successful multiplayer games in record time. For non-gaming, our **Industries Circle** gives you the complete suite plus exclusive license options.

## Install and Migration Notes

## Introduction

Bot SDK is mainly divided in two parts:

1. The **Visual Editor** created for easily defining and tweaking the Bots behaviours;
2. The **deterministic AI code**, implemented as part of the Quantum simulation, directly integrated with the editor.

It currently supports the following AI models:

1. Hierarchical Finite State Machine ( **HFSM**);
2. Behaviour Tree ( **BT**);
3. Utility Theory ( **UT**);

When using this addon, the choice of the AI technique(s) that will be used is the project is completely up to the user:

- It is possible to design all of the bots using only one technique;
- Or design some bots using HFSM, others using UT, others using BT;

Find out the pros and cons of each AI model on their specific pages.

For understanding the basic addon setup and testing it out, take a look at the [Bot SDK Sample](/quantum/current/technical-samples/bot-sdk-sample).

## Opening the Editor

Go to the Unity's top menu and navigate to `Window > Bot SDK > Open Editor`, which opens the following window:

See what is the current state in which the HFSM Agent is
See what are the last three transitions taken by that HFSM Agent (works hierarchically)
See what are the current states on the left panel, to easily see all of the current states considering the hierarchy

- Keyboard numeric Enter is now also used to confirm some editing actions
- Clicking on some transition slot doesn't delete that transition anymore. Instead, drag and drop it to re-direct some transition to another state
- Right click transitions to access the Delete button
- Variables on the left side menu are now ordered by alphabetical order
- Actions and Decisions are also now ordered by alphabetical order
- Actions and Decisions nodes can now have its names changed on the Visual Editor (right click on it to edit). This makes no difference to the actual actions and decisions classes
- Created a menu to fix events/blackboard variables from former Bot SDK versions
- Added the transition Priority to the top view on the graph, on the state node
- No longer generates a Blackboard asset when there is no Blackboard Variable on the visual eitor

* ANY Transition
- Added Excluded List to it, which allows the user to inform states that should not consider that ANY transition

* Compilation
- Removed code which was causing the compilation process to take the double of the time needed
- Improved a lot the compilation time by re-using the previous data assets structure to prevent re-creating assets unnecessarily

* Debugging
- Added new toolset for debugging HFSM agents. Its main features are:
Select some Game Object on your Hierarchy tab which represents some HFSM Agent and has the HFSMDebugComponent added to it in order to open its HFSM editor
See what is the current state in which the HFSM Agent is
See what are the last three transitions taken by that HFSM Agent (works hierarchically)
See what are the current states on the left panel, to easily see all of the current states considering the hierarchy

* Quantum code
- Created the AIContext, which is used to reference Constants and Config data assets and can be set differently for bots which has the same HFSM but uses different values
- Changed the way that Transition Sets were handled on the HFSM core code

* Constants
- Created the Constants menu on the left side part of the editor
- Constants can be used to define nodes with a default type, and the same constants node can be used as input for many fields

* Blackboard
- On the Visual Eitor, added a new slot on every Blackboard node: the value slot, which can be used to define where some Action/Decision reads some value from
- Fixed serialization issue for entities which has the Blackboard Component and are Created -> Destroyed-> Created (respawned)
- Fixed serialization issue regarding using the Blackboard component during matches between different platforms (cross platform)
- Fixed serialization issue regardinsg usint the Blackboard component on replays

* AI Param
- Created a new type that easily changes the source from where it reads values: the AIParam
- Public AIParam fields can be defined, on the Visual Editor, from a value set by hand (click to edit), from a Blackboard node or a Constant node
- AIParams are strongly typed, so they are used as AIParamInt, AIParamFP, AIParamBool, etc

* Unity Assets
- Added new asset: HFSMDebugComponent

* Issues
- Fixed issue on using Events on ANY transitions
- Reduced the amount of SetDirty called for the data assets created, which was causing a bug during compilation on some Mac OS machines
- Added custom header on the default Bot SDK actions/decisions to prevent the Reset method to be created. It was also the cause of issues during compilation
- Fixed precision issues regarding closing/opening circuits with FP values. Every re-open would make the FP value change. FPs are now stored as their internal long value
- Fixed issue when (de)serializing the XML document. It didn't use InvariantCulture so it would cause errors depending on the machine's localization. Issue happened with some czech localized Windows machines
- Fixed issue in which OnExit actions would be called right after entering some state which has children states
- Fixed compilation and runtime issues when some states were named the same
- Fixed nodes being in incorrect states if it was created as a result of drawing a new transition. It was generating broken nodes after copying and pasting it
- Documents are now saved before assembly recompilation to prevent loss of document modifications
- Fixed the Circuit window when the game is on Play mode


Aug 15, 2019
- Bot SDK 1.0.0 Release Candidate 2

* Visual Editor
- Mute Transition option, accessible by right clicking on a any transition's line or on
its in/outbound slot. Muted transitions will be ignored during the compilation process;
- Mute State option, accessible by right clicking on a State node. Muted states are
ignored during the compilation process, so no transition will lead to that state. The
HFSM will not compile if you mute the Default State;
- Mute Action option, accessible by right clicking on a Action node. It is possible to
mute any Action, no matter its position on the actions list. If a muted action is linked
to another action, then the other action will still be executed;
- Editor screen panning using direcional arrow keys;
- Actions and Decision nodes will automatically add or remove its fields list based on
changes performed on the quantum_code (such as adding/removing fields);
- Actions and Decisions nodes fields are initialized with the values defined on quantum_code;
- Warning logs if some Action/Decision isn't serialized. Those Actions/Decisions wont show on the pop up menu in this case;
- Actions/Decision fields always showing its values. There is no need to select the node to see the values anymore;
- Transitions are now labelled with their Event name if there is no custom label defined;
- Added menu to create Blackboard information within the editor view from which your
custom Blackboards are created and from where you can drag and drop the Blackboard keys as nodes.

* Blackboard
- Blackboard Initializer asset, which can be used to define initial values for blackboard instances;
- Fixed issue on Blackboard's memory allocation;
- Added optional compilation symbol (USE_BLACKBOARD_FRAME_METHODS) to define if the Blackboard will not use Frame's partial methods.

* Unity Assets
- Compiling a HFSM generates both a Blackboard asset and a BlackboardInitializer asset for that agent;
- Fixed redundancy between SettingsDatabase and AssetLinksDatabase assets which led to invalid cast errors;
- Downgraded all assets versions. Assets were previously generated from Unity 2019.1.0f2, now it is generated from Unity 2018.4.0f1 LTS.

* GOAP
- Reduced the amount of GOAP re-planning: it now happens when the agent's Goal changes and when the agent's Current State changes

* Changes on quantum_code BotSDK folder's content:
- Included the Samples folder with some very simple pre-defined Actions and Decisions
