# Animation

## Overview

In Quantum there are two distinct ways to handle animation:

- Poll the game state from Unity; and,
- Deterministic animation using the `Quantum Animator Addon`.

## Polling Based Animation

Most games use animation to communicate the state of an object to the player. For instance, when the playable character is walking or jumping, the animations are actually _In Place_ animations and the perceived movement is driven by code.

In other words, the scripts managing the characters' respective (Unity) animator are stateless and simply derive values to pass on as animation parameters based on data polled from the game simulation (in Quantum).

**N.B.:** If the gameplay systems rely on _Root Motion_ or have to be aware of the animation state, then skip to the next section.

Here is a code snippet showcasing a basics of caching relevant Unity components and getting a frame from a QuantumGame retrieved from the update view callback, then reading relevant data from the frame and applying it to the animator. On Unity, make sure to only use the Frame API for **ready only** operations, as writing to it from Unity would be non-deterministic.

C#

```csharp
namespace Quantum
{
  using UnityEngine;
  public class CharacterAnimations : QuantumEntityViewComponent
  {
    private Animator _animator;
    public override void OnInitialize()
    {
      _animator = GetComponentInChildren<Animator>();
    }
    public override void OnUpdateView()
    {
      var kcc = PredictedFrame.Get<CharacterController3D>(EntityRef);
      _animator.SetFloat("Speed", kcc.Velocity.Magnitude.AsFloat);
    }
  }
}

```

### Trigger Events

Some animations are based on a particular events taking place in the game; e.g. a player pressing jump or getting hit by an enemy. In these cases, it is usually preferable to raise an event from the simulation and have the view listen to it. This ensures decoupling and work well in conjunction with the polling based animation approach.

For a comprehensive explanation on events and callbacks, refer to the `Quantum ECS > Events & Callbacks` page in the Manual.

From Quantum, a system can trigger a Quantum Event when a character jumps:

C#

```csharp
namespace Quantum
{
    using Photon.Deterministic;

    public unsafe struct PlayerMovementFilter
    {
        public EntityRef EntityRef;
        public PlayerID* PlayerID;
        public Transform3D* Transform;
        public CharacterController3D* Kcc;
    }

    unsafe class MovementSystem : SystemMainThreadFilter<PlayerMovementFilter>
    {
        public override void Update(Frame frame, ref PlayerMovementFilter filter)
        {
            var input = frame.GetPlayerInput(filter.PlayerID->PlayerRef);
            if (input->Jump.WasPressed)
            {
                frame.Events.PlayerJump(filter.EntityRef);
                filter.Kcc->Jump(f);
            }
        }
    }
}

```

On the Unity side, a Unity component can listen to the `PlayerJump` event and reacts to it. These steps are necessary to achieve this:

1. Define a method that can receive the event - `void Jump(EventPlayerJump e)`.
2. Subscribe to the event in question.
3. When the event is received, check if it is meant for the GameObject the script is located on by comparing the `EntityRef` contained in the event against the one cached earlier.
4. Trigger / Set the parameter(s) in the Unity Animator.

The definition of the event, in any `.qtn` file:

Qtn

```cs
event PlayerJump { EntityRef EntityRef; }

```

Reacting to the event in a Unity component:

C#

```csharp
namespace Quantum
{
  using UnityEngine;
  public class CharacterAnimations : QuantumEntityViewComponent
  {
    private Animator _animator;
    public override void OnInitialize()
    {
      _animator = GetComponentInChildren<Animator>();
      QuantumEvent.Subscribe<EventPlayerJump>(this, OnPlayerJump);
    }
    private void OnPlayerJump(EventPlayerJump e)
    {
      if (e.EntityRef == EntityRef)
      {
        _animator.SetTrigger("Jump");
      }
    }
  }
}

```

### Tips

- Place the model and its animator component on a child object.
- Events are not part of the game state and thus are not available to late/re-joining players. It is therefore advisable to first initialize the animation state by polling the latest game state if the game has already started.
- Use synchronised events for animations that need to be triggered with 100% accuracy, e.g. a victory celebration.
- Use regular non-synchronised events for animations that need to be snappy, e.g. getting hit.
- Use the `EventCanceled` callback to graciously exit from animations triggered by a cancelled non-synchronised events. This can happen when the event was raised as part of a prediction but was rolled back during a verified frame.

## Deterministic Animation

The main advantage of using a deterministic animation system is tick precise animations which are 100% synchronised across all clients and will snap to the correct state in case of a rollback. While this may sounds ideal, it comes with a performance impact since animations and their state are now part of the simulated game state. In reality only few games require and benefit from a deterministic animation system; among those are Fighting games and _some_ Sports games.

The Quantum Animator is a tool enabling deterministic animation. It works by baking information from Unityâ€™s Mecanim Controller and importing every configuration such as the states, the transitions between the states, the motion clips and so on.

Since Quantum 3, the code has been open sourced and is available for download on the `Addons > Animator` page. This page also provides an overview and a quick-guide on how to import and use the tool.

Keep in mind its features are limited and it will likely have to be adapted to your needs.

### Tips

- Before using the Quantum Animator, consider whether the animations are tied to the gameplay or merely a visual representation thereof. In the former case the Quantum Animator is a suitable solution, otherwise polling based animation is the way to go.
