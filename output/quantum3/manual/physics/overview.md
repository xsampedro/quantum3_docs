# Overview

## Introduction

The Quantum physics engine is cross-platform, deterministic and fully supports Quantum's predict rollback model.

This section covers 2D, 3D and 2.5D Physics documentation.

**Important:** the 2D and 3D APIs are _very_ similar. This will become apparent in the provided code snippets; each code snippet will be presenting the 2D code followed by its 3D equivalent.
