Preview

The Quantum SDK 3.1.0 is provided as development snapshots and is **not** intended to be used for live or released games. There may be blocker bugs and the API can change or break during the preview phase.

To ensure quick support and iterations new SDK packages will be published as **nightly builds**.

Make sure to read the [What's New in 3.1](/quantum/current/getting-started/preview-3-1/whats-new) article.

## Changelog

### 3.1.0

#### Preview

Disclaimer: The Quantum SDK 3.1.0 development snapshots are not intended to be used for live games.

##### Build 1878 (Oct 29, 2025)

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: An issue where clients with certain heap configurations would desync upon late-joining

##### Build 1873 (Oct 23, 2025)

**What's New**

- Support to scheduling multiple Physics Updates in the same frame simulation

##### Build 1872 (Oct 21, 2025)

**Changes**

- The default heap management mode for migrating projects is now the new `PageBased` mode instead of

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: An issue where `FrameBase.ComponentCount` throws an `AssertException` for table components that have never been added to an entity

##### Build 1871 (Oct 18, 2025)

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: A regression where ECS internals would GC allocate when iterating elements of `ComponentSet`
- Fixed: An issue that caused pause mode stepping in Unity Editor to not simulate one tick at a time

##### Build 1870 (Oct 17, 2025)

**What's New**

- Added a NavMesh import option to load auto-generated navmesh links directly from the Unity navmesh, only works in Unity Editor
- Added `QuantumRunnerExtensions` methods to simplify starting Quantum in different modes by providing specific Init()-methods to create `SessionRunner.Arguments`, see the usage inside the `QuantumRunnerLocalDebug.cs` script for example
- Quantum instant replays now also work when being activated during a replay

**Changes**

- Renamed `QuantumGame.CreateSavegame()` to `GetSnapshotFile()`, retired the `QuantumRunnerLocalSavegame.cs` script and merged its functionality with `QuantumRunnerLocalDebug.cs`
- Corrected a typo in `QuantumRunnerUnityFactory.CreatePlatformInfo` and changed the static method to a property
- Removed the `StartWithFrame()` method from the `QuantumRunnerLocalDebug` class

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: A bug where multiple tasks dispatched from the same `SystemThreadedFilter` can visit the same entities. (The slice length was not being respected.)
- Fixed: An issue that caused the navmesh agent to chose any navmesh link instead of the closest one when having multiple links available that connects two triangles
- Fixed: An issue that caused the `QuantumRunnerLocalDebug` script to not apply the `SimulationSpeedMultiplier` when using `EngineDeltaTime`

##### Build 1869 (Oct 16, 2025)

**What's New**

- `Quantum.Compression` \- an abstract base class for compression algorithms. Comes with two implementations: `CompressionDotNet` (default) and `CompressionSharpLibZib` (enabled when `com.unity.sharp-zip-lib` package is present). Using the latter might help with "Runtime Speed with LTO" Web builds issues. Both implementations produce the same results and rely on `GZip` format

**Changes**

- `ByteUtils` compression methods made obsolete, use `Quantum.Compression` instead
- `CollisionChecks` in Physics2D and Physics3D namespaces are now static classes

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: System task profiler entries not being recorded in non-development builds

##### Build 1865 (Oct 15, 2025)

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: A regression where filters didn't skip entities pending destruction
- Fixed: An issue that caused the heap settings in SimulationConfig of existing projects to not be migrated correctly

##### Build 1863 (Oct 14, 2025)

**Breaking Changes**

- The `DeterministicSessionConfig` inspector now computes the `Hard Tolerance` based on the `Simulation Rate`, input `Offset Ping Start` and input `Offset Min`, to override this behaviour toggle `Override Hard Tolerance`

**What's New**

- Added `Prediction` statistic to the GraphProfilers and QuantumStats window that shows how many ticks the simulation goes into prediction

**Changes**

- Some stats on the QuantumStats window are now smoothed and show an average (1 second) to make them more readable

##### Build 1862 (Oct 11, 2025)

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: An issue that could cause an ArgumentException similar to `X cannot be greater than Y` after late-joining

##### Build 1861 (Oct 10, 2025)

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: An issue in the component block iterator that could cause the exception `\_blockCount > 0`

##### Build 1859 (Oct 09, 2025)

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: An issue in `QuantumStartUI` that caused multiple builds on the same machine that all used the same user name to not join the same room
- Fixed: An issue that caused the `QuantumStartUI` to show the popup window when stopping the Editor during connecting

##### Build 1854 (Oct 08, 2025)

**Breaking Changes**

- The library `Quantum.Deterministic.dll` was merged with `Quantun.Engine.dll` and remnants of the old dll have to be deleted from projects that migrate to SDK 3.1
- The `DeterministicSessionConfig` inspector now computes the `Hard Tolerance` based on the simulation rate and input offset ping start, to override this behaviour toggle `Override Hard Tolerance`
- `SessionRunner.Arguments` now requires setting an explicit `TaskRunner` to be set. This can be done by either specifying `TaskRunner = QuantumTaskRunnerJobs.GetInstance()` or by implicitly setting the TaskRunner by using `GameParameters = QuantumRunnerUnityFactory.CreateGameParameters` for Unity. Use `TaskRunner = new DotNetTaskRunner()` outside of Unity
- The demo input `.unitypackage` now requires the installation of the Unity module `com.unity.inputsystem`
- `Quantum.Profiling.HostProfiler` was renamed to `Quantum.HostProfiler`

**What's New**

- Added `table` components, which are an alternative to the sparse set ECS components that scale better, see the documentation for more details
- Added a new physics solver `ProjectedGaussSeidel` that greatly improves the stability when stacking rigid bodies, to use the legacy solver select it in the SimulationConfig
- Added `SimulatorContext` to exposes simulation callbacks, which allow for modifications to future simulation and prediction advancements, see the documentation for more details
- Optimized the memory required to store the sparse set ECS components which increases the performance of frame copies
- Added new counters to the `GraphProfiler` to track bandwidth for incoming and outgoing traffic
- Added Unity profiler counters such as `Q Frames Verified`, `Q Frames Predicted`, and `Q Simulation Time`, that can be added to the Unity profiler windows as a custom profiler module
- Added new non-biased random number generation methods to `RNGSession`: `Next(long, long)`, `NextInclusive(long, long)`, `Next(uint)`, `Next(ulong)`, `NextUInt32()`, `Int64()`
- Added `QuantumIgnore` label support - apply to an asset to be ignored by `QuantumUnityDB`, useful on prefabs that are used as map prototypes exclusively for example
- Added `SimulationUpdateTime.EngineUnscaledCappedDeltaTime` which uses a capped version of unscaled delta time, this improves support for breakpoints and Unity Editor pausing in local mode
- Added an `FP` converter utility window that converts `double` to `FP` and raw values
- Added a new configurable value called `Heuristic Weight` to the `NavMeshAgentConfig` which can improve the performance of the A\* algorithm algorithm, try setting it to `1.5`
- Added support for Unity's `InputSystem` actions which is now used by the demo Quantum input scripts

**Changes**

- The default simulation rate was increased from `60 Hz` to `64 Hz` (using powers of two), ensuring that `DeltaTime` has no rounding error and providing greater precision in physics calculations
- The multi client scripts have been moved out of the SDK package into a `.unitypackage` (`Assets/Photon/Quantum/PackageResources/Quantum-MultiClient`)
- Exporting replays and snapshots via the menu now saves the last save location as a relative path
- Changed the NavMesh API by renaming `Map.NavMeshLinks` to `Map.NavMeshAssets` and by removing the property `NavMeshAgentConfig.AutomaticTargetCorrection` instead `AutomaticTargetCorrectionRadius` \> 0 is checked to test if target correction is enabled
