## Provide Context

Let us know

- the **SDK and SDK version**
- the affected **appid(s)** _if you mail or ask in a private channel_
- the **engine /editor version** if you use Unity or Unreal
- the target platform if it's a console, Android, iOS or WebGL

If you run into bugs, send

- **what happens versus what you expect**
- the full **exception** if there is one
- **how often** it happens: all the time, x out of y attempts, in some builds or situations
- complete **txt logs** can help a lot, screenshots and videos sometimes
- **what you tried** to fix the problem
- if our demo(s) also have this bug or succeed at the task

If the problem happens only in some networks, send

- the used protocol: UDP, TCP or WSS
- `ping` or `tracert`/`traceroute` results
- if this is on IPv4 or IPv6 (with DNS64/NAT64)
