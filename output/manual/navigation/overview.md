# Overview

![Navigation Intro](https://doc.photonengine.com/docs/img/quantum/v3/manual/navigation/navigation-intro.png)

The Quantum navigation system provides a deterministic **Navigation Mesh** and a set of **Navigation Agent** components to navigate and steer entities through the game worlds.

- [Importing A Unity Navmesh](workflow-navmesh)
- [Creating Navmesh Agents](workflow-agents)
- [Agent Avoidance](avoidance)
- [Using Navmesh Regions](regions)
- [Using Navmesh Off Mesh Links](links)
- [Custom Navmesh Generation](customized-navmesh)

### Features

- A\* path-finding algorithm
- Autonomous agents navigate to target destination through the navmesh
- Parts of the navmesh can be toggled on and off during run-time (regions)
- HRVO agent avoidance
- Dynamic avoidance obstacles (not navmesh carving)
- Off-mesh links
- 3D Navigation
