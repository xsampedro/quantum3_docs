# Bot SDK Sample

![Level 4](/v2/img/docs/levels/level01-beginner_1.5x.png)

## Overview

This is a very simple showcase of Bot SDK features. Use it to decide if it fits your needs, or to get inspired on how to approach AI on your projects.

## The Collectors Sample

![Collectors Sample](https://doc.photonengine.com/docs/img/quantum/v2/addons/bot-sdk/little-guys.gif)
The bots' objective is to collect jewels and put it in the box.

The sample contains:

- Sample code and AI documents for:
- Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM);
- Behaviour Tree (BT);
- Utility Theory (UT);

The quantum solution also comes with some samples on how to handle:

- Player Replacement: how to replace a player by a Bot if the player got disconnected during the match;
- Filling Room: how to fill the room with Bots if there are not enough players connected to the match;
- Bot Entities: creating entities which are **not** related to Players at all.

All of these configurable using the `RuntimeConfig.User.cs` file.

## The Spellcaster Sample

The sample contains:

- Sample code and an AI document for a Utility Theory agent (UT);

The Spellcaster is the AI agent. It's objective is to protect it's castle from the enemies.
