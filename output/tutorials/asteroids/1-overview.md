## Introduction

Welcome to the Quantum Asteroids Tutorial.

In this step-by-step tutorial you will learn how to use Quantum to create a simple multiplayer game.

## Expectations

Quantum is a high-performance deterministic ECS engine for online multiplayer games. Quantum greatly simplifies multiplayer development, however it requires a different approach where gameplay code is strictly decoupled from the view/rendering.

Accordingly, at least a general understanding of C# and game development concepts in Unity is expected. Quantum's APIs are designed to be easy to use, but having prior experience using the ECS pattern and working with pointers in C# is a plus.
